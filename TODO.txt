1. TODO: Write unit test that ensure that the same exact PDF uploaded twice doesn't generate two documents in the DB
2. CURRENTLY WORKING ON: Knockout representation of document -- This URL Works:
   - http://localhost:8850/xtractpdf/dev.php/library/fd6ffef8028de9b6db576142c3a77af2?response_format=json
   - Look for assets/library-single.js for Knockout model
3. Command-line junk:
   - Rename the extract command so that it makes more sense ('build') and option for what builder to use
   - Commands for managing the collection: dump (dumps using a renderer), search, list, etc.
   - In the end, we should have:
         doc:build [builder] [params]
         doc:render [id]
         doc:delete [id]
         docs:find   -query {querystring}
         docs:list   -order {order} -l {limit}
         docs:delete [ids,ids,etc]
         docs:clear
