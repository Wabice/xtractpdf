0. UPLOAD and restrict access (via .htaccess)...
1. Bug with uploading regenerates same PDF in library
2. Clear button on certain sections to erase all non-necessary content
3. If PDFX extraction fails, just generate a new document
4. Move JavaScript that is currently in the workspace template to main template
5. Implement JATS-XML render and export from model capability
6. Sidebar should update when title or mark complete is changed in workspace form

DONE:
0. Reworking Data Model - Need to also rework the PDFX extractor to use the new model
   and the workspace builder to pull from the new model.  It is hierarchal:
1. Implement Jquery UI drag-and-drop capability: http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#option-handle
2. Auto-remove line breaks (?) on c!opy/paste (http://goo.gl/iXPtA)
3. Fix default height for paragraphs and citations in form
4. Fix submitter so that it submits the entire form when doing an AJAX POST (build a new class to resolve it from the POST model)
5. Link the "Mark Complete Checkbox" to API endpoint with 'mark'=true added-on datafield to serialized form and test
6. Style fixes to the left-hand sidebar when the list grows too long (Jquery scroll API)
7. Upload and test on FF + Chrome!!
8. Workspace header perhaps should be fixed
9. Re-add Abstract Section
