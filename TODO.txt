0. UPLOAD THIS SHTUFF
1. Rewrite the Library/DocumentAPIHandler and rethink the builders to be more flexible.  buildFromPDFStream() and buildFromPostAPI() and
   a way of indiciating which is supported, ...or... different class interfaces altogether... or just leave it...
2. Command-line junk:
   - Commands for managing the collection:
   - In the end, we should have:
         doc:build [builder] [params]
         doc:render [id]
         doc:delete [id]
         docs:find   -query {querystring} -order {order} -l {limit}
         docs:list   -order {order} -l {limit}
         docs:delete [ids,ids,etc]
         DONE - docs:clear 
3. Write JATS exporter
