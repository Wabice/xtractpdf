0. Make an optional configuration item for discriminator field in DocumentModel and manager so that different copies of the app can use the
   same collection in the database..
1. UPLOAD THIS SHTUFF
2. Rewrite the Library/DocumentAPIHandler and rethink the builders to be more flexible.  buildFromPDFStream() and buildFromPostAPI() and
   a way of indiciating which is supported, ...or... different class interfaces altogether... or just leave it...
3. Command-line junk:
   - Commands for managing the collection:
   - In the end, we should have:
         doc:build [builder] [params]
         doc:render [id]
         doc:delete [id]
         docs:find   -query {querystring} -order {order} -l {limit}
         docs:list   -order {order} -l {limit}
         docs:delete [ids,ids,etc]
         DONE - docs:clear 
4. Write JATS exporter
