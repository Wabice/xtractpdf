1. Currently working on refactoring builder interface so that ::build method doesn't always *require* a stream (think about this carefully)
4. Rewrite upload method in library controller
5. Write library front page
7. Command-line junk:
   - Rename the extract command so that it makes more sense ('build') and option for what builder to use
   - Commands for managing the collection: dump (dumps using a renderer), search, list, etc.
   - In the end, we should have:
         doc:build [builder] [params]
         doc:render [id]
         doc:delete [id]
         docs:find   -query {querystring}
         docs:list   -order {order} -l {limit}
         docs:delete [ids,ids,etc]
         DONE - docs:clear 
8. Write JATS exporter
