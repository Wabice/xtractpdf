0. RIGHT NOW - Reworking Data Model - Need to also rework the PDFX extractor to use the new model
   and the workspace builder to pull from the new model.  It is hierarchal:

   Doc
    - Meta
      - Authors
    - Abstract
      - Sections
        - Paragraphs
    - Content
      - Sections
        - Paragraphs
    - Citations

1. build workspace interface and AJAX functionatlies
   - Implement Jquery UI drag-and-drop capability: http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#option-handle
   - Link the "Mark Complete Checkbox" to API endpoint with 'mark'=true added-on datafield to serialized form and test
   - Fix submitter so that it submits the entire form when doing an AJAX POST (build a new class to resolve it from the POST model)
   - Fix default height for paragraphs and citations in form
   - Make actions only visible on :hover for form items
   - Auto-remove line breaks (?) on copy/paste (http://goo.gl/iXPtA)
2. Style fixes to the left-hand sidebar when the list grows too long (Jquery scroll API)
3. Cross-browser testing on many PDFs
4. Implement JATS-XML render and export from model capability
