Left off:
1. implement Mongo ODM annotations on Models
2. refactor upload class to use the Models and Persist
   - if the document already exists (do an MD5 on the actual file contents itself), then don't overwrite
3. add persist feature to command (again, don't overwrite)
4. build workspace builder from model
5. implement JATS-XML export from model capability
