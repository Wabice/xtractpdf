CURRENTLY:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Write JATS renderer
2. Improve audit logging - it currently logs the old version of the changes, not the new version
3. Improve audit logging; see if we can get the 'diff' logic out of the biblio controller and into the documentMgr
4. Write bibjson renderer (http://www.bibjson.org/)
