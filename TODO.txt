CURRENTLY:
1. Created AuditLogEntry, AuditLogger, and added log interface to DocumentManager - Time to connect em through the App
2. Need the discriminator field (see below), but need to think about how to handle duplicate uploads across different
   subcollections... do we show an error or allow the upload?  If we allow it, we need to create a composite unique
   index on the Document model made up of the discriminator field and the uniqId.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

0. Make an optional configuration item for discriminator field in DocumentModel and manager so that different copies of the app can use the
   same collection in the database..
2. Rewrite the Library/DocumentAPIHandler and rethink the builders to be more flexible.  buildFromPDFStream() and buildFromPostAPI() and
   a way of indiciating which is supported, ...or... different class interfaces altogether... or just leave it...
3. Command-line junk:
   - Commands for managing the collection:
   - In the end, we should have:
         doc:build [builder] [params]
         doc:render [id]
         doc:delete [id]
         docs:find   -query {querystring} -order {order} -l {limit}
         docs:list   -order {order} -l {limit}
         docs:delete [ids,ids,etc]
         DONE - docs:clear 
4. Write JATS exporter
